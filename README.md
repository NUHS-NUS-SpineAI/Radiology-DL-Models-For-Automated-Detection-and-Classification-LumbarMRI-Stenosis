[Article link](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/abs/10.1148/radiol.2021204289) _(Published online: May 11 2021)_

In the paper, we develop and apply AI techniques to automatically detect and classify lumbar spinal stenosis on MRI images.

## üéì What‚Äôs In This Repo

The setups and implementations of our system are documented in their respective folders:

- [**Object Detection**](Object-Detection/)

Based on Tensorflow object detection API, we pick Faster R-CNN with Resnet101 architecture pre-trained on COCO dataset to detect region of interest (ROI).

- [**Classification**](Classification/)

CNN architecture consisting of six convolutional layers, outputing four-grade classification predictions.

- [**Inference**](Inference/)

Predict relevant spinal regions (ROI) and infer the disease grades, automatic generation of XML outputs and bounding boxes with probability overlays.

- [**Interpretability**](Interpretability/)

Explainable AI technique using Integrated Gradients provided by Tensorflow Core.
